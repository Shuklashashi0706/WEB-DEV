<!-- DOM specification
Describes the document structure, manipulations, and events, see https://dom.spec.whatwg.org.
CSSOM specification
Describes stylesheets and style rules, manipulations with them, and their binding to documents, see https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-1/.
HTML specification
Describes the HTML language (e.g. tags) and also the BOM (browser object model) – various browser functions: setTimeout, alert, location and so on, see https://html.spec.whatwg.org. It takes the DOM specification and extends it with many additional properties and methods.
Additionally, some classes are described separately at https://spec.whatwg.org/.

Please note these links, as there’s so much to learn that it’s impossible to cover everything and remember it all.

When you’d like to read about a property or a method, the Mozilla manual at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ is also a nice resource, but the corresponding spec may be better: it’s more complex and longer to read, but will make your fundamental knowledge sound and complete.

To find something, it’s often convenient to use an internet search “WHATWG [term]” or “MDN [term]”, e.g https://google.com?q=whatwg+localstorage, https://google.com?q=mdn+localstorage.

Now, we’ll get down to learning the DOM, because the document plays the central role in the UI.

An HTML/XML document is represented inside the browser as the DOM tree.

Tags become element nodes and form the structure.
Text becomes text nodes.
…etc, everything in HTML has its place in DOM, even comments.
We can use developer tools to inspect DOM and modify it manually.

Here we covered the basics, the most used and important actions to start with. There’s an extensive documentation about Chrome Developer Tools at https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools. The best way to learn the tools is to click here and there, read menus: most options are obvious. Later, when you know them in general, read the docs and pick up the rest.

DOM nodes have properties and methods that allow us to travel between them, modify them, move around the page, and more. We’ll get down to them in the next chapters. -->
