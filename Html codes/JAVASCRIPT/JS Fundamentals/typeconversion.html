Summary:
The three most widely used type conversions are to string, to number, and to boolean.

String Conversion – Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with String(value). The conversion to string is
usually obvious for primitive values.

Numeric Conversion – Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with Number(value).

The conversion follows the rules:

Value Becomes…
undefined NaN
null 0
true / false 1 / 0
string The string is read “as is”, whitespaces (includes spaces, tabs \t, newlines \n etc.) from both sides are ignored.
An empty string becomes 0. An error gives NaN.
Boolean Conversion – Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with Boolean(value).

Follows the rules:

Value Becomes…
0, null, undefined, NaN, "" false
any other value true
Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

undefined is NaN as a number, not 0.
"0" and space-only strings like " " are true as a boolean.
Objects aren’t covered here. We’ll return to them later in the chapter Object to primitive conversion that is devoted
exclusively to objects after we learn more basic things about JavaScript. -->
