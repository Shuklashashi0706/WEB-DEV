<!-- Summary
There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

Seven primitive data types:
number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(2^53-1).
bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean for true/false.
null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
symbol for unique identifiers.
And one non-primitive data type:
object for more complex data structures.
The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

Usually used as typeof x, but typeof(x) is also possible.
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.
In the next chapters, we’ll concentrate on primitive values and once we’re familiar with them, we’ll move on to objects. -->
